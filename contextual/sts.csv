STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	3.00	You'll need to check the particular policies of each publisher to see what is allowed and what is not allowed.	If you need to publish the book and you have found one publisher that allows it.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		You should check the conditions of your journal using the SHERPA/RoMEO list.	You should read the copyright transfer contract that you have signed.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		It is not completely true that failures are not published.	One of the consequences of not reporting failures is publication bias.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I started one with that goal in mind back in high school (I'm in college now).	I have never heard of an academic journal specifically meant for high school students.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.60	I am not aware of any university run participant pools.	At the universities I've worked in North America, human-subject studies (esp.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Citing online articles without a clear author depends on the citation format.	There are probably several answers depending on the situation and on the standards in your field.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		http://www.higheredjobs.com They have jobs broken down by Job Category, Region, and Institution Type.	At this point I am a broken record: this is one of the situations I found myself in.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.00	Apart from admission (which normally should not be related to age), there is something that's related to your question.	Age is not a PhD admission facor in the continental Europe, too.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Receiving an invitation to help out at a NSF or NIH study session is highly unlikely and logistically difficult.	Reviewing grant proposals as a student is tricky, at least in some fields.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		It might be worth mentioning this while you are applying for PhD positions.	If the award is sufficiently prestigious then you should list it, otherwise you should not.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		So far, I think this is better to make a rotation of the instructor.	Aside from having common exams, one possibility is to withhold the names of the instructors until the registration is finished.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think it predominately depends on how you are accessing the other university's resources.	I would not explicitly acknowledge people who have helped you access papers that you don't have access to.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Yes, high-profile journals do typically edit figures for style and consistency.	As grauwulf comments, your job is to focus on the content.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Aeismail makes an important point about location: what's standard in Germany differs from what's standard in the US.	Like so many other matters, your location plays a role in what is considered accepted or not.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I have been using a mode for Emacs called Org-mode to track my research and do project planning.	I highly recommend Wunderkit (recently released) and Wunderlist for organizing to-do list, and taking notes.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		What's the best way to make corrections to a published paper?	Journals oftentimes make their procedures regarding varying types of corrections available on their website (e.g., Nature).
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I recently attended the annual meetings of the European Economic Association.	One recent conference I've heard that supports such an application is Ubicomp 2012.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If you're a first/second year grad student, go because you have to.	Let's ask another question: is there at least one good reason not to go at the seminars?
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		To add to other answers: How often one publishes in the most prestigious general journals (e.g.	Another thing is (in conjunction with the number of publications) the number of coauthors, i.e.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think that the problem is that often many professors underestimate the PhD student's will and personal scientific aims.	One difficulty is that it's far from clear what the ideal dropout rate should be.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.60	This post refers to research in the STEM fields, and may not be applicable to other research topics.	This is about my experience in computer engineering I found that reading for breadth was the more important approach.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		HaL (hyper archive en ligne) is a French open archive repository that covers all fields.	Figshare is a rather new service (compared to ArXiv) that is just starting to gain momentum.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.80	If you don't want to pay for Adobe Acrobat Pro, as @schultem mentions, LaTeX can do this with embedded hyperlinks.	If you don't mind hosting your files online, SlideShare is a good solution.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think your method (thesis title in the education section) is the standard one.	Some people publish their theses as part of a monograph series.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think it really depends on how long you plan to work without salary.	Why not just bring up the idea of staying in your current lab with your advisor?
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		My practice is to replace the initial preprint with the postprint as soon as it is accepted.	I believe you should never include Submitted to Journal of Blah; it conveys no information and it's tacky.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Doing outstanding research is what ultimately matters, not the rank of the university.	I don't entirely disagree with the two previous answers: taking the offer you have now may be a fine choice.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	2.40	I don't think there are likely to be any standards that address this issue specifically.	You're going to find answers all over the map for this one (i.e., there probably aren't standards).
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Your question likely indicates that you need to work on your communication with your advisor.	My advice: don't read everything otherwise you will never finish!
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If your paper are on arXiv you can use myarticles widget.	An even easier solution that doesn't require anything except the ability to upload a BibTeX file is Exhibit.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I know that TikZ was mentioned already, but I think it deserve its own answer.	Mathematica is actually good for making all sorts of graphics.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		plain text/markup language For mathematics, I think TeX/LaTeX is the way to go.	binary/plain text Other things to consider (for the future) is the movement towards standard meta-data items contained with the research articles (e.g.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I've seen three common ways of funding staff - undoubtedly there are more.	Funding for non-research positions comes from either direct or indirect sources.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.00	My answer would be depending on which GRE are you referring to?	The problem I see with the GREs is that the scoring range is highly compressed.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		A good starting point would be to talk to your research advisor about how to handle this, and follow his/her advice.	And, as a small point, if one's work is confidential for the reason that it is so extremely useful/important/wonderful (!?!
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		You could ask members of your doctoral committee to write you a letter of recommendation each.	You need to strategize with your advisor, or a trusted mentor, about this.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		You should do what makes you happy and you find interesting.	You can definitely apply in a different field than your undergraduate.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.20	If you have access to it, you can very easily do that with Thomson Reuters‚Äô Web of Science portal.	You can have a look at the arXiv cultoromics website at http://arxiv.culturomics.org, which however searches in articles on the arXiv.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I did this in the earlier stages of my career, when every little bit of CV weight helped.	On the one hand, it shows that you are engaged in this necessary part of scientific research that is peer-review.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I can also add some other pointer I've come to learn over the years on what constitutes a good reviews.	There are certain things I look for when reviewing papers that are show stoppers, i.e.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		A strong factor for most people will be the financial impact, i.e.	I applied to six graduate schools in my field, and was accepted at all of them.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I would allow rescheduling, but be sure to use a different exam.	In my school, redo exams have a maximum grade of the minimum grade to pass.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I have frequently had to micromanage my students' presentations and writeups.	The first thing I would do is improve/repair your personal relationship with your adviser.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I'm going to answer this question based on my understanding of copyright law in the United Kingdom.	German copyright is very different from UK or US copyright.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.60	In general there are a number of different distinct workflows that lead to a poster.	For completeness, Apple's Pages has quite a few nice poster layouts.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In my field a peer reviewed article counts for a lot more than a chapter in an edited book.	Like a lot of things in academia, I think this will heavily depend on what discipline you're in.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		For everything that have been reviewed AND permanently archived then the bibliography is fine.	The best practice is to include standard bibliographic information, a relatively stable hypertext link for current readers (e.g.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Many universities have a unit devoted to providing support with grant applications.	If you are writing proposals for NSF consider volunteering as a reviewer in your discipline.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I agree with the other answer that this is a normal occurrence.	Depending on which country you are talking about, there may be league tables for the universities in that country.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	3.60	It is perfectly okay to ask for the figure knowing well that the other person may not give.	You can always ask, then it is the choice of the author to accept or not.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There are no services to help you get that coursework accredited.	Most of the courses that I've seen explicitly state that you obtain no credit for doing the course.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In my very personal opinion MDPI is an reputable publisher, but their journals are not first-class.	The peer review process generally differs between predatory and non predatory journals.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think what you are asking can be carried out using Web of Science.	Adding to Gopi's comment, here's a snapshot of Academic map at work.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		aeismail's answer points out two very important points: the deal-breakers and the PD purgatory.	Actually, I think the frame of this question isn't quite right.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The biggest problem with such repositories is that someone has to maintain them.	If you have access to it, you can very easily do that with Thomson Reuters‚Äô Web of Science portal.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In general, I believe, that graduate science education is not a good choice from a purely financial standpoint.	You didn't mention if you want to do an MS in the UK or the US.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		As you do more things, you can become more selective with what you list.	First of all: note that there is a difference between an academic CV and a resume.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I have one addendum to the great answers by F'x Pedro, and Henry.	From your description, it sounds like the problem is more likely to have been the MSc supervior than the student.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		One thing that I haven't seen mentioned yet is intellectual property rights.	Whatever you are going to do after PhD is your business.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.20	The academic year does start around September in the USA and I think most European countries.	I would not accelerate things, to avoid getting worse grades that you want.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		A book I would recommend is Kosslyn's Graph Design for the Eye and Mind.	The preeminent author on this topic is Edward Tufte, who wrote The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If you can re-take the GREs without undue burden -- yes, re-take them.	Many PhD programs in computer science (like my own) don't require GREs; read the application instructions carefully.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.20	I will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for A !	You could defer admission, but it's a little unusual to defer for a year.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		http://www.glassdoor.com/ works by getting anonymous information from users and sharing it.	I think this page has what you are looking for.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		All of the above... but maybe not wanting a book that started from a primer on Linear Algebra.	The answer can best be understood in terms of the intended goal of the researcher making the switch.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		This is such a loaded question I'm hesitant to answer.	Like @Suresh says, in the US, I would expect that the advisor-advisee relationship would be separate from enrollment in the department.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		At some universities, a Post-Doctoral Fellow is a different title than a Post-Doctoral Researcher due to federal regulations in the USA.	In addition to Suresh's answer, I'd say that a postdoc is no longer a student.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		For presentations, when you are using graphics from other papers, you refer to the paper.	There are two parts to this question: citation and copyright issues.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Remember that Europe is a big place, comprised of lots of different countries.	There are tough (read respectable) and relatively easy (read weaker) schools and PhD programs in both sides.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Here's an answer based on my experience in the United States.	Everywhere I've attended and worked in Britain, I've called teachers by their first name and been called my first name.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		A link to a profile page that makes it clear you're a grad student should be enough.	Personally I hate signatures, I see it as trying to make a superficial impression based on a title.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		is there a way to measure my own reviewing bias?	There aren‚Äôt many ways for your to evaluate how your reviews stand against others, but there is at least one.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I'll tackle the easiest side of the question first: bringing nothing should not create trouble.	A gift to show your gratitude will always be appreciated.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Applying to Masters Program does not really depend on one single factor but a variety of factors.	Yes, the acknowledgements section of your paper is an appropriate place to thank anyone who provided valuable assistance.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I feel like pointing out that the very use of the word 'productivity' reflects a certain kind of bias towards quantity.	There is no accepted numerical measure for an individual's academic productivity.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		PubMedCentral gives you full text and their API may be able to do it.	There seems to be no service or tool that let's you download articles in bulk.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		This recent Nature news item would seem to suggest rather strongly that SCIRP is not a serious outfit.	Yes, I  do indeed have some direct experience with them.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I checked the peer review policy of Nature and Science, I guess that should is the best we can get.	Well, as you said, there is no rule that explicitly says that the information mentioned in a ‚Äúinvitation to review‚Äù is confidential.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I don't know how common it is, but certainly some institutions allow student papers.	Have you tried asking your supervisor to deposit the papers?
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.00	Edit, again: The question seems to have changed, yet again.	I can think of three reasons why a faculty member might reveal how a student performed on a qualifying examination.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		True story: a bottle of wine (well, maybe just half a bottle).	Second, I try to process 10 or so exams before actually marking any of them.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Script only the introduction I can only echo what Artem said about the disadvantages of a script.	I think a script is actually more harmful than good.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.00	I agree with Seteropere completely, Network Science is a very broad subject.	I would say you are approaching it in the wrong way.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I prefer to group definitions of notation and symbols with the typical List of ... elements.	Email the work to someone (or yourself) well before you hand it over.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If you use bibtex, then you can batch edit with things like sed, awk, or simple find/replace in any text editor.	In my experience, the author syntax changes if you're using DOI or PMID.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think the answer to your question is very dependent on your subject and the culture of that research area.	I agree that reference formatting for a thesis tends to follow university and discipline specific guidelines.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The first rule, as usual, is: what is expected of you?	I always view we as you and the reader and you and your reader journey through the subject together.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I would say that it depends on the complexity you get out of it.	You should definitely consider publishing the algorithm, but not before you could say something more than merely a pseudocode.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		How many publications or conference papers would you get out of this work?	I've known of a few cases of people prolonging their Ph.Ds to improve their CVs.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.20	Supporting an ideology in an ostentatious manner (rather than privately or discreetly) is a personality problem.	I think for an appropriate answer I'd need to know exactly what the 'bad' ideology is.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		When asking a question, it is desirable to explicitly establish a non-confrontational tone.	My personal preference is not to offer a compliment in this setting.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for A !	For questions 1 and 2: it depends: you have to find out from your individual advisor/department/university.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If there's a medical reason for it and the student can produce an appropriate doctor's certificate or what not.	You will definitely need to check regulations regarding the wearing of costumes that conceal one's appearance.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.00	This does not fully answer your question, but it is certainly one consideration.	I am a PhD student in Computational Science, which is an interdisciplinary major spanning mathematics, computer science, and engineerning.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		TV-L is the German public servant remuneration grade table (Tarifvertrag f√ºr den √ñffentlichen Dienst der L√§nder (TV-L)).	I am sure a psychologist could provide an indepth analysis to a large part of this question.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		nobody cares about your university, the only important thing at least in Europe is your CV.	Does doing a postdoc mean a commitment to an academic career?
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The biggest obstacle is that you haven't been through a Ph.D. program.	It can be very difficult to get government financing depending on where you reside.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.40	A few possible problems: 1) Such an ID system seems a little intrusive.	In mathematics, we already have a database of this sort - two them, in fact, with in MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Short answer: The full name is Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Tekhnicheskaya Kibernetika.	As others have said, not every (old) article has a DOI or a URL.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In your case, how do you find 14 good leaders from 70 students?	My armchair researching dug up a lot of articles about this.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		It depends on whether the black hole is rotating or not.	It's complicated, and it depends on what you mean by black hole.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.40	As an complement to the other answers, let me address the question of why planets tend towards tidal locking.	The other answers here are fantastic at explaining in a technical sense.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	3.00	Stars are rotating, but that's not the cause for their stability.	Stars rotate due to the angular momentum of the gas they formed from.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Of course the apparent relative sizes of the sun and moon are coincidental.	As a matter of fact, yes, it is only a coincidence.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	4.40	It indeed appears the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and The Milky Way (MW) are en route to a collision.	In a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Stellar mass black holes form from the collapse of massive stars at the end of their lives.	Stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes likely form from very different mechanisms.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The metal content of the Solar system is completely dominated by the Sun.	The metals that are forming in the sun come from nuclear fusion.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	3.20	The short answer is: we are made from the stuff contributed by many stars.	It is highly unlikely that we're made out of stuff from only one star.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	3.40	All we know is this : Distant objects are receding from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us.	The expansion of space means that objects in cosmological distances are receding away from each other.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		When you sit in a car, and you suddenly brake, you feel the change in velocity.	If you're big enough and fluid enough, like an atmosphere, you would feel acceleration do to the Earth's motion.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There is no 'still' that is not relative to some other object.	The so called expansion of the universe is not as trivial as most people think.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	3.40	Like Chris said above, stars rotate to conserve their angular momentum.	Stars are rotating, but that's not the cause for their stability.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The light will eventually reach galaxy B even though the space between them is expanding.	To answer your question: The speed of light is relative to the metric of the space itself.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	3.60	According to this website the peak visible magnitude will be about 10.5 around February 2nd.	The AAVSO data seems to indicate that it might have already peaked, at around 10.5 (visual).
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.80	All of these effects are related to the 11 year solar cycle.	I will be specific to answering the part regarding the prediction of solar flares.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Dark matter, is just a name for something we know nothing of.	Light may account for a small portion of dark matter, but it is unlikely to account for most/all of it.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Compared to the planets the moon changes it's rise and set times very quickly.	The moon didn't abruptly change position, it is gradually and continually changing position.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.80	We are moving ... relative to the comoving cosmic rest frame ... at some 371 km/s towards the constellation Leo.	There is no 'still' that is not relative to some other object.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.00	Yes, it's true that the apparent size of the Moon is 30 arcmin.	When you gaze at the moon live, you are not seeing a still image.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.60	Let us assume the data for a globular cluster to be equivalent to that of M13.	Globular clusters occupy an interesting place in the spectrum of composite stellar systems.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		You'll probably need spectrometer data to distinguish and identify spectral lines.	No, amateur astronomy equipment is not capable of doing such an analysis.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		To complete Envite's answer, I would point that you can easily experience that irregularity yourself.	Any body with an irregular mass distribution will experience those wobblings.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		4 billion years is the same timeframe of the life remaining to our Sun.	Normally when two galaxies collide, it is the gas that interacts with each other.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The outer shell of the star contains still a lot of hydrogen, after running out of fuel.	If something crashed into it rearranging its content a bit, could its life be extended?
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.00	Why is the speed of light 299,792,458 m/s, and not (for instance) 3,1 or 4,3 x 10^44 m/s?	Speed of light being finite is one of the fundamentals of our Universe.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Molten Iron and hot sand - it's not easy to think of something more extreme than this.	So far, we don't have anywhere near enough detail to identify weather on planets in other star systems.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		What you're asking, basically, is whether there are any proofs for the heliocentric model of the Solar System.	According to Newton, any binary system revolves around the center of mass.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		It very much depends on where on the globe you are in terms of your latitude.	To add to TidalWave's answer, here's another way to think about it.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Only a very small fraction of the elements in the core the supernova get converted into heavier elements.	For a star to become a nova, it needs to have a mass at least 8 times greater than our sun.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	3.20	As per your definition, a star formed in a binary system (hence near some gravitating body) is a generalised planet.	The main flaw with your definition of a generalised planet would be the boundary between stars and planets.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		One additional source of evidence comes from other spiral galaxies.	In addition to @MBR's answer; there are other (less confusing) ways to represent the data.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		What you're asking, basically, is whether there are any proofs for the heliocentric model of the Solar System.	A black hole has an event horizon which 'marks the point of no return'.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Naively, I would say that you're looking for a periodicity in the luminosity.	Any body with an irregular mass distribution will experience those wobblings.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The energy density of the universe is quite well known.	No energy is in transit as GRBs, just like Gamma rays that started in a GRB.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Even though I'm a professional astronomer (but not an expert on this field), I don't have a good answer.	I can't give you an explicit ant mathematical explanation but maybe this simulations give you a hint.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Light may account for a small portion of dark matter, but it is unlikely to account for most/all of it.	In addition to @MBR's answer; there are other (less confusing) ways to represent the data.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The mass luminosity relation is non-linear (L = M^3.5 for the main sequence) so more massive stars burn at a much faster rate.	The easiest way to think of it is terms of the cube square law coming into play.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Well, when two black holes collide a new black hole is created.	There are currently three classifications of black hole and these are stellar, super massive and miniature.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There is a prior answer here claiming that a moon with a moon would be an unstable system.	I don't think there are any in the Solar system.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		As far as I know all accretion disks are prograde.	Consider a binary system with a neutron star and a companion star.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		From 1979 to 1999, Pluto was the eighth planet from the sun.	No, Pluto is a so called resonant trans-neptunian object; the orbital period of Pluto is almost exactly 3:2 (1.5) times that of Neptune.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	2.00	A method used to calculate the distance between stars is 3 Dimensional trigonometry.	You only need two-dimensional trigonometry if you know the distances to the two stars and their angular separation.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The light will eventually reach galaxy B even though the space between them is expanding.	To any observer between 'A' and 'B' where the light wave passes, it passes with the speed of light.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Like Afzaal Ahmad said black holes evaporate through Hawking radiation, proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974.	Yes, everything that is in this universe has to say Good bye to its existence.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		You're experiencing a few issues all of which have one solution.	Regarding the fact of using the scope indoors: it's understandable, but silly.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Space, as we experience it, is simply three-dimensional Euklidean (flat) space.	Particle like, molecule or atoms or any smallest particle behaves differently in different environment.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Stars can form in circumstellar disks, that are, in general, disks surrounding forming stars, but not in protoplanetary disks.	Yes, unless you want to get really particular with the protoplanetary part.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.00	The farther away, the faster the galaxies move away from us.	Here is my answer to a similar question posted on the physics stack exchange website.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The programs I am aware of that you could use do require some programming expertise to operate.	Yes, there is are two python modules called astropy, and astropysics that both claim to have spectral analysis tools.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Main difference (beyond mass, which we can extrapolate to make giant clusters and small galaxies touch) is star age.	There are a couple of important distinctions between the two types of objects.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		No, the orbiting rocket was not visible to the naked eye.	In the protostar stage of the Sun, it was surrounded by a (spinning) gas cloud.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		From a (more) physics standpoint our acceleration on earth is basically zero from what we can feel.	When you sit in a car, and you suddenly brake, you feel the change in velocity.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		After all these astronomic answers, I will add a computer one.	Yes, it's true that the apparent size of the Moon is 30 arcmin.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think you mean to ask, What is the local sidereal time of Greenwhich?.	Right Ascension is a celestial coordinate, not a terrestrial one.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I believe your confusion is from combining two popular simplifications of our Universe.	The surface of the 4-dimensional ball (called 3-sphere) is a slice through the universe as a whole for a fixed cosmic time.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Yes, we always look into the past, when looking somewhere.	I think the question is referring to situating a very large mirror in space facing earth.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		This is one of the great remaining mysteries of the universe.	In these quantum theories, forces are mediated by particles called gauge bosons.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Yes, binary comets do exist; 8P/Tuttle is an example of one.	If the closing velocity is very low, the energy can be dissipated by the comets squishing.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		No - Distances between objects get larger, but galaxies and clusters are dominated locally by gravity.	Ummm this question made me think about a lecture from my teacher.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Nickel plating can improve the surface, but it's not easy in detail: paper on nickel plating.	The aluminum oxide layer forms as soon as oxygen comes in contact with the mirror surface.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The colorful patterns of gas are caused by excitation of gas atoms, e.g.	You might be interested in these two answers: How dense are nebulae?
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		This has not been answered yet for sure I guess.	You are making the mistake of thinking that there was a single spot in space that everything expanded from.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There are a few more elements which you might consider.	The tail particles from a comet are ejected, so they have a distinct velocity than that of the comet.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Gravitational lensing is the effect that large amounts of gravity have on the path of light.	One star passes in front of another from our perspective.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Pluto: It was disqualified as a planet because orbital dominance was not achieved in the case of Pluto.	Disclaimer: Most of what is written here is based highly on theory and speculation.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		No, not all total lunar eclipses will turn the Moon deep red.	The redness of the moon is due to Earth's atmosphere refraction of Sun rays and pollution - dust particles etc.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		What I mean to say is, how are the characteristics of event horizon related to Space-Time?	Depends on how the angular momentum (that manifests itself as Earth's rotation) would be absorbed.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In addition to Undo's fine answer, I would like to explain a bit about the motivation behind the definition.	The correct answer is 8 (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		charon and pluto are tidally locked, as is the moon to the earth.	It would require a very precise trajectory for an asteroid to end up in geostationary orbit.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.60	Stars form in star-formation regions, which itself develop from molecular clouds.	It may be possible for a solar system like ours to exist outside of a galaxy.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If so by how much does it spoil the view of stars and galaxies etc.	It does not act as a solid lens, because it does not have a limit surface.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Well, Kepler has explained that 2 randomly moving objects, attracted towards each other, will always form elliptical orbits.	When an object is in orbit, there are two factors at play, not just one.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Dark matter, is just a name for something we know nothing of.	As Yashbhatt said, we can detect light: with our eyes (visible light only) and with special machines.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.00	A black hole (briefly), is nothing more than a dead star whose mass was more than 3 solar masses.	I think you mean to ask, What is the local sidereal time of Greenwhich?.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I'm not sure I understand your question entirely, but i'll do my best to offer a decent answer.	No, it is not since Jupiter is not a star.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Astronomers use this system simply because it is (was) convenient.	In order to know when a star will be above horizon, you'll need an equation with times, not celestial latitudes.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In the upper photosphere, the electrons join with the ions to neutralize the atom.	Emission and Absorption lines are due to Kirchhoff's Laws that explain what happens when light passes through a gas.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Over the past 150 years, telescope technology has improved immensely, so we can now see much further than in the past.	There are a couple of different horizons you should care about.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Temperature ($T_{eff}$) can be quite tricky to determine accurately as it interrelates to a number of other fundamental measurements.	The star reaches a critical mass and ignites, blowing away the surrounding material.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		We have not discovered every galaxy in existence, nor have we watched each to see how it is spinning.	Rotation: One of the easiest way to show that galaxies rotates are Doppler observations of atomic or molecular lines.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Asphalt roads do a great job at heating up cities!	Actually this is one of the possible ways we have in order to make Mars friendlier to humans.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.80	I  believe one cannot taste the difference between minced(canned) and fresh garlic once it is cooked.	In my experience, fresh garlic is great for when you want texture, or to slow down the flavour infusion.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Since you note that the inside was nice and juicy, I doubt that salting 30 minutes in advance was the culprit.	It sounds like you may be searing the steak for too long.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		As long as you complete the salmon's cooking in the sauce, it's fine.	Freezing kills the parasites in fish that are harmfully to humans.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I would recommend Bottomfeeder if you're interested in this topic.	Consider the castiron stuff from Le Creuset; my father-in-law has one that's at least 50 years old and it's still going strong.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I can't see any reason for the marinating itself to make any difference.	I suspect it depends what kind of cheese the whey came from.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I don't think I've ever head of a kitchen tool like that.	If you have a local deli, it's at least worth asking to see if they'd cut your meat for you.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I've never put oil on spaghetti's water and i've never seen anyone doing it here in Italy.	In my opinion, all else being equal, Italian style water-boiled pasta tastes bland.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Since we don't drink alcohol at home, I don't ever have real wine at home.	You can replace the moisture provided by wine with just about any flavorful liquid, but you won't replicate the flavor.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I was taught to sift then measure, and to scrape the excess off with a knife.	As others have said, you're essentially screwed if you're using volume to measure flour.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If you're going to use the egg yolks without freezing them you'll typically need to use them the same day.	Eggs can't read calendars and so the expiration date is only a guide.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I don't do sourdough in warm weather, it wastes too much flour.	You just have to add more flour and water periodically so your yeast doesn't die.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Fairly standard fonduta recipe: dice fontina and just cover with milk, leave to sit for a few hours.	Vacherin, Comt√© or Emmental, I wouldn't go for Gouda, it's not cheese from the fondue regions.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		For something requiring no preparation, my first choice would be Maggi Sauce, which is non-soy based.	Try some using sesame oil to go with that garlic and ginger idea.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		It's not dangerous but it significantly impacts the quality of the meat.	As the water in the muscle fibers freezes it expands and creates a mushy texture.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I'd leave it singular unless talking about a range such as 0.25 - 2 miles.	It's really not complicated or confusing if you think of it in terms of being a fraction.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The subject of the sentence were the payments, and not the total number of payments, therefore were is correct.	Since payment is countable, I would go with were to reinforce the notion that there was more than one payment.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Religious practice is far more common than religious praxis (500 000 vs. 15 000 results in Google).	The word praxis is definitely an extremely formal academic word.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Well since your question contains nothing to compare to and is therefore ambiguous, the answer could only be yes.	The more languages you know, the easier it generally is to learn new ones.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Contrary to some of the other answerers, I do think intuition blurring is a real thing.	Languages can often be distinguished based on prosodic information alone.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Perhaps you could start by studying how you pronounce English /w/, which consists of simultaneous labial and velar approximation.	Try looking in a mirror into your mouth while producing some words like fill feel hello ladle larry bottle etc.

I think that the basic observation about agglutinative languages generally not having complex tonal systems is pretty well upheld.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Our greatest asset For comparison, basically, human and animal have similar purpose in life, those are, survival and enjoyment.	Cicero's Hortensius, though effectively lost to us, appears to have been an answer to this very question.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		First, you must be using humanist in an idiosyncratic way.	If everyone can create meaning based on personal preference not some philosophical idea it will amount to contradiction.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Most contemporary philosophers would interrogate the concept of happiness, pain, and even human nature.	From a survival prospective, it is clearly not necessary to be happy to survive.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		First, other sciences can have their concepts explained without math.	One way to think of mathematics is the study of patterns1.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		This varies depending on which logical system you're working in.	A syntactic proposition can be evaluated to be correct or not semantically via truth tables.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		How objects are named is something of a mystery to me.	The closest thing to the study of naming objects today, it seems, would be semiotics or semiology.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.80	I can imagine a scenario where a single all powerful god create the universe that we know of.	It is the same idea as what Aristotle called the unmoved mover.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		A more idiomatic paraphrase of ~(x)Bx is: not everything is a bird.	You've actually (perhaps unintentionally) asked a controversial question in the philosophy of logic.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		On a temporary basis and as an ongoing personal philosophy selflessness is possible but a consistent selfless life is unsustainable.	Anything we do based on our thinking and our emotions.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		This argument is about as sensible as saying that -1 is absurd because a negative apple doesn't and can't exist.	You overlook that human color experience is an overlay of the input of three color receptors.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If not, what is preventing happiness from being quantified, in principle?	We use zero to represent a piece of information: that is, that there is zero of some collection.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		personally, i think u just identified one of philosophies greatest weakness, the lack of practical value.	Philosophy is one of many human endeavours to find a meaning in life, and universe, and so on.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Nothing is very difficult to conceptualise - we only approach it by analogy.	The principle of sufficient reason states that nothing is without  reason, but why are there  any contingent truths?

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The interface between ACR and Photoshop has changed a couple of times over the years.	Adobe in their wisdom decided to force you to upgrade Photoshop if you splash out on a new camera model.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		A more expensive option is a remote trigger like the wireless pocket wizards and the cable for your camera.	I am very happy with the Phottix Plato it is a wireless solution that is cost effective.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		It is important to remember that RGB is an additive process, and CYMK is a subtractive process.	I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but I'll try and cover all the bases.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There's no simple rule of thumb due to the inhearent nonlinearity in the equations.	Depth of field formulas are indeed complex and nonlinear, but they still afford useful rules of thumb.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Although you could fix this problem in lightroom with reasonable results, you can fix it when taking the picture.	The old way of solving this problem, I mean before digital post-processing, was to apply foundation cosmetics on the model face.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Ken Rockwell claims, and I agree, that the D5000 in quiet mode is pretty darn quiet.	From what I've read and seen, I don't think there is any real significant difference between 1.5 and 1.6.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I used to think that blurring was one of those things that was impossible to recover from in post.	If the photo is blurred due to camera shake, you really don't have many options.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If you took a look at the image that your camera initially takes, you'd be disappointed in it.	I may be wrong, but I don't think that what you are looking for is feasible.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In my (admittedly limited) experience, in-lens stabilization (Nikon D90 + 18-200mm) works a lot better than in-body (Pentax K200D + 18-250mm).	Lenses are generally the most expensive part of photography equipment and likely to be kept longer than bodies.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		For what it's worth, dirt on the lens might not be as detrimental as you would think.	There's no right way to do this, it's what works best for you.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Bear in mind that the aperture will usually have to be set manually too.	Apart from aperture and focal length, depth of field also decreases with camera-subject distance.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		They could, on the other hand, more easily extend their own RAW format(s).	There is something particularly conceptually wrong with throwing away the stuff that comes out of your camera.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Personally, I just guess, take a shot and look at my histogram and tweak as needed.	Its not linear, its a square,  so if you double the distance, you need 4 times the light.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Aside from the better quality of the EF-S 10-22mm lens, it offers a significantly wider angle of view.	The 10-22mm lens is the perfect complimentary to the 18-55mm when it comes to nature and small room photography.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Photoshop Elements is $99 and is very close to Photoshop in terms of features for photographers but much cheaper.	The wider your aperture, the smaller your focal depth will be.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The most important fact - which is buried in one of the previous responses - is focus speed.	Stabilization is primarily intended to help when your shutter speed is less than the reciprocal of your focal length.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		You can use free, open-source utility Exiftool to extract the metadata from the JPG files.	Why not stop using JPEG images and use RAW exclusively?
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Two things need to be considered here: focusing speed and adequate sensitivity to light to achieve a fast shutter speed.	Often a faster lens will be sharper even at the same aperture as a cheaper lens.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think this is an example of: use the opportunities you have, rather than the ones you wish you had.	Polarizers and neutral density filters will go a long way to help this, but they are not a panacea.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There's really only one thing you need to memorize and it's easy: a list of standard f-stops in graduations of one f-stop (1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64, 90).	For the exposure, you can try an analog light-meter, like the Gossen Lunasix.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I upgraded from 400D to 7D and things just got sharper (and you should expect the same).	It has to do with the sensor size - large sensors require correspondingly larger lenses.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Reid is right - that VR does not help at all in stopping motion.	Completely agree with Reid... in this situation a fast prime is the way to go.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In short: you can enlarge it as much as you like.	That all depends on the viewing distance, and, to a lesser degree the brand, age and speed of the film.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If you can find a used 7d I'd jump on it, but chances are, you won't at a price oyu'll like.	Background compression is part of how we perceive perspective in a photograph.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There are numerous kinds of optical abberations that you may encounter with a lens.	I'm trying to write down a more photographer oriented answer.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Sometimes the amount of exposure compensation available (ie +/- 2 stops) in Aperture priority mode might simply not be enough.	Manual mode can give you more consistent metering when you're taking several photos in a scene.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The camera will only ever do a quick format as there is a limit on read/write operations on flash memory.	I format my card every time I stick it in my camera and start a shoot.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I have the 35mm 1.8 and the 50mm 1.4 - and for people wanting thier 1st fixed prime I always point them at the 35mm 1.8 1st.	Only when we consider all these factors do we come up with a 'normal' focal length value of about 50mm.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.40	For what it's worth, dirt on the lens might not be as detrimental as you would think.	Regular dish washing fluid is great for removing grease, as it not only dissolves it but also binds it.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Polarizers do block light, as they are designed to filter out light coming from certain directions.	Aside from focal length, the most important thing to consider is the maximum aperture of the lens.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If you're not feeling the limitations of your point-and-shoot camera, then you probably don't need a DSLR.	They aren't better per se; They just tend to allow greater artistic control over the result.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Adobe Photoshop Elements is actually a pretty good package these days.	There are quite a few alternatives, depending somewhat on what you're after.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The exposure settings to stop moving objects depends entirely on how fast the objects are traversing your frame.	Most important:  put your camera down for a while and make a snowman!
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		First of all, what you have is probably mirror pre-fire rather than a true mirror lockup.	Mirror lockup is used to reduce vibrations with longer exposures.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		If you're primarily interested in video, the Nikon option offers 1080p and 24 frames per second with autofocus.	I'd recommend reading an article from Philip Bloom, a professional filmmaker who uses DSLRs on a daily basis.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I'm going to be very short: you should set a singular purpose (goal) for yourself.	I'm asking for some resources (books, websites, etc) or personal advice that would help me overcome this situation.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I'm writing here a few tips that can help you with motivation.	You are incorrect when you say these aren't important when in reality it is important since it annoys you.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I tried listening to music also, but after some time your ears get hurt and that's disturbing.	From my experience the noise-cancelling headphones will not work for longer periods.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Self-discipline is good to a certain degree, but overdoing it can be counter-productive.	I'm assuming you finish your share of work before starting any entertaining activity.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	2.60	I think 90 days is the absolute most you can plan out in a single time period.	Definitely plan a month ahead - it's totally OK for your plans to change - just amend them as they do.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I bought Typequick and set aside a practice time everyday for about a month.	Just do a lot of programming and you'll pick it up over time.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Mendeley is a free alternative to Evernote (but they also have a Pro plan for more features).	I would suggest using  Zotero, I created a Zotero folder to-read to pile up the pending papers.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Our body's sleep patterns respond to light by production of serotonin and melatonin.	I have to agree with pretty much all the above, but it mostly comes down to what your limits are.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.40	I like the previous answers regarding setting a schedule and fulfilling the rituals of going to a job.	Buy a 3 panel screen and use it to separate the work area from the sleeping area.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.60	I disagree with Josh Bruce on some of his tips.	Research does indicate that sleeping after studying is a pretty good rule-of-thumb.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	3.40	Currently I've got a fairly close to purely digital GTD setup, although this could do with some refinements and tweaks.	My GTD system is effectively 100 percent electronic--as described in detail here.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Part of the answer, at least, is that some people just can't do it.	As a software developer myself, I am doing this right now.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		First of all, if you are not familiar with GTD, I'd encourage you to read up on the literature.	I suggest looking into the book The Now Habit by Neil Fiore.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I use a trackball mouse controlled by thumb, so my experience may be different.	I used a Kensington Pro Mouse ($120 at the time) for about 8 years until it croaked a few months ago.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Amazon allows any Kindle user to set up an email address (username@kindle.com) which you can email documents to.	The Calibre eBook management application can do exactly this and more.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Blogging about what you're learning about is so completely useful.	I would like to hear perspectives from others on this since I've not yet gotten around to trying it myself.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I would suggest doing a thorough and honest evaluation of your time.	Why not just pick a regular schedule of where you'll work, and when?

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I had always thought she was the daughter of a Daniel the 7th cylon.	I've always figured she was the same thing that Head Six and Head Baltar were.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There are many races in the Star Trek universe that are so near-human there may be no discernible difference.	Humans in the Star Trek universe are expansionistic, not self-destructive, and breed easier than similar species.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think Voldemort's arrogance has to be included in the equation.	Voldemort probably thought he was very clever, stumbling upon the Room of Requirement.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Storm Front is probably the worst of the Dresden books.	Never read the Hollows, but can answer the parts about the Dresden universe.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The best explanation comes from Picard in Star Trek: First Contact.	There was definitely a money system in the Star Trek Universe.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I would start with the Chronicles and move on to the Legends series.	Mark Roger's answer of Chronicles, Legends, and Tales is a good answer.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		We know that the Puppeteer homeworld achieved 3% of the speed of light in 8 years, according to Juggler of Worlds.	How close to the Ringworld was the Fleet of Worlds?
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		This comes from The Gripping Hand, the sequel to The Mote in God's Eye.	The way I understand the history, the concept of a ‚Äúgripping hand‚Äù did originate in The Mote in God's Eye (published in 1974).
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The same way they got the van, the guns, and their clothes into the dream.	It's all part of the consciousness being shared by the dreamers.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		It's similar to the wind-up tech used in olden toys and watches.	I'd say the closest we have to that now would be a using a flywheel.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Various bits of them can be used for magical purposes.	The blood is used to extend life or heal wounds.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The most obvious answer is that the energy shield does not extend all the way to the ground.	I don't know what level of Canon the old Rogue Squadron games were, but I remember playing the Hoth level.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I still think it could be River in the suit.	It has not been revealed in the story yet, so everything is speculation.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think it's a reference to Nathan's mother's boyfriend, Jeremy.	The black dog is a portent of death in many English folk tales.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		How would they be able to keep pace with the lesser, illogical races of the universe if they did?	Mathematics is a very logical langage and the Vulcans speak it all the time.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think that they do, at least they replicate the majority of the components and assemble them by hand.	With regards whole ship replication, there are notes in the Next Generation Technical Manual.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		No, Harry dropped the Stone before is encounter with Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest.	He was shot with Avada Kedavra, but he never died.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I had always thought she was the daughter of a Daniel the 7th cylon.	I thought, too, that she was an Angel in keeping in line with the original series.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think the whole point is something like quality rather than quantity.	I think the concept is that the insects trapped in amber are essentially unchanged as they are completely sealed off.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Surely the facehugger would have the same kind of blood as the aliens themselves?	There's no reason why the first thing that the facehugger does has to be to extend the ovipositor.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In Wishful Drinking http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1705977/ Carrie Fisher brings up her changing accent.	In Episode IV, Carrie Fisher pronounces Han Solo's first name as if he were the leader of the Han Dynasty.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The unofficial reason is that JKR found it difficult to do something new in the Quidditch matches every book .	There was an official explanation, at the beginning of the year, that there was no Quidditch house cup.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I have two reasons that work not only within the Star Wars universe, but our own as well: Visibility.	The directional thrusters wouldn't have to be in the rear of the ship but really that point doesn't matter.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.80	I'd be more inclined to believe that it's some sort of ring world.	It is not hollow, it is round just as our world.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I've not seen Origins, but this has been inconsistently displayed through the comics.	The Adamantium didn't replace his bones, they just covered them.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	2.80	On the one hand, there‚Äôs nothing in canon to suggest that the Time Turners could go forwards in time.	Time Turners were explicitly mentioned for use in going back in time.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.60	First of all, let me say that there seems to be 3 main traits to casting a spell.	I always thought that Harry seemed to learn from the Half-Blood Prince better than he did from other sources.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Well, first, I think it's because Harry is better than Hermione at Defence Against the Dark Arts in general.	The Patronus Charm, according to the Harry Potter series, is a powerful spell.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I'd say yes, he was a Sith - just not a very good one.	Going by the Rule of Two, Vader can only become a Sith master if he strikes down the Emperor himself.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Not an official reference as 2000AD online has not opened their wiki to the public.	I don't see how you can say it's an allegory based on just those points.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.80	I started watching the Stargate series by watching Atlantis first!	Without delving into an in-depth analysis of Atlantis and Universe, I'll try and be as succinct as possible.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		So far there is no definitive answer in the books who the Prince That Was Promised is.	Melisandre herself admits that she makes mistakes reading the fires, interpreting the images she sees wrongly.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There are several drive types in various games and shows that avoid dilation by not actually generating velocity.	At 80% of the speed of light, the time dilation is only 5:3 - one second on the ship is equal to 1.67 outside.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		To answer your second question, they were definitely not named because of that capability, even if the capability existed.	No, there is no mention of them being designed to cling on to a saucer section.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		As far as I have noticed, Elantris and Warbreaker are completely independent; there are no connections between their plots.	Quantum Teleportation and Molecular Replication The transporter and replicator technologies appear similar to the outside viewer.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Real World Answer: The discrepancies are a series of continuity errors.	There's also the possibility that lower-priority messages are sent in a way more analagous to e-mail than a phone call.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Answering your question of whether or not Voldemort knew Harry was a Horcrux: No, he did not.	Count of seven was 7 pieces of soul - this included his own chunk.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.20	It was before the season began because Amy saw the woman before the Silence took her.	The exact timeline hasn't been listed yet, but there are a few assumptions we can make.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Let's assume that the planet only orbits one of the stars.	In practice binary star systems can have the stars very widely spaced.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.00	We have two parallel worlds in collision or maybe more.	Our intrepid heroes also didn't pursue the child who was in the spacesuit.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		We became the world described in it over the last 10 years.	Portions of this book hit really close to home in our present society.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		To add to what jwenting said, you can clearly see Vader hit by the emperor strikes.	I am pretty sure it was the 1952 Omnibus of Science Fiction.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		What do you mean by reincarnation as opposed to a ghola?	Humans in the Grid seem to age at the same rate they do outside the Grid.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		This is an Alderson Disk and has been featured in Godwheel.	It could be Pratchett, he has written stories other than those in Discworld; one of them is Strata.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		That logic is like assuming because of the HP Pavillion DV6000, there must have been 5999 previous models.	There were actually several ships of the Constitution class with numbers lower than 1700 and which were built after the Constitution.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Storm Front is probably the worst of the Dresden books.	I agree with @apoorv020's post, but think it could be expanded upon.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Yep, the book pretty clearly states that the boat was designed for two - 1 Wizard and one not.	No, I don't think there is any good reason why not.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		TL;DR (for my answer, not the question): Depends on the author.	According to the World War Z novel, the zombie digestive tract doesn't work.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There's a mythical creature called a Namazu - a giant catfish.	Hayao Miyazaki is known for his fairy tale styled movies.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Mark Roger's answer of Chronicles, Legends, and Tales is a good answer.	I once did some research on this and compiled two reading order lists.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Surely the facehugger would have the same kind of blood as the aliens themselves?	While the other answer is quite well thought out, there's another possibility I've been thinking about for years.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In Anne Rice novels vampires wake up each night with the hair they had when they became vampires.	I dont know if it's a cannon answer, but A Chemical depilatory like Nair would do the job.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I suspect it was deliberately kept vague to make a good story.	I don't recall very clearly, but I think this issue was raised in the first movie.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		After taking a random guess, I figured I'd do some more research and find out more details.	It's hard to tell exactly how much time has passed from the outbreak to the start of the show.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Aside from factual details in DavRob's answer, they are different applications.	Snow Crash was published in 1992, but it was written well before that.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		First, it is explicitly stated that electronics don't work in areas with a lot of magic around.	In order for Muggles to use weapons, a number of things would have to happen.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I think that the British cultural aversion to guns would apply in this case.	In order for Muggles to use weapons, a number of things would have to happen.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		While all of these are very good suggestions and they have some sort of evidence as backup.	Those are a kind of symbiotic protozoa or bacteria, aren't they?
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.40	Dick was an idea guy and a people guy, not a science guy.	Most of Philip K Dick's works aren't hard Sci-Fi in the least.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		From a purely technical standpoint, it was clearly a design flaw in that it went STRAIGHT DOWN.	The Empire doesn't regard a one-man fighter as a threat, or they'd have a tighter defense!
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.00	First, we must consider that Sphere is less Hard SF and more soft SF, thriller, airport novel and such.	Fins on real spacecraft are usually for one of two purposes: solar panels or thermal radiators.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.60	According to canon, Leia was an expert in combat, especially shooting (this is from EU books).	In real-world combat, most fire is used to suppress the enemy, not kill them.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I‚Äôm going to make some suggestions that might help us make more sense of, Why the Cup?!	I have seen all of these other than Confessions d'un Barjo as it is French and really hard to find.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange was written in 1962, and contained an entire lexicon of Nadsat slang.	Star Wars (at least the extended universe) has a fairly robust set of profanity.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I also read up on some stuff while playing the game and afterwards...	Whatever you do, start with Eisenhorn (or maybe even Inquisition War) or Gaunts Ghosts, or something else.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.80	I don't think we have a solid theory of mammal speciation.	The short answer is that evolution couldn't create gills in humans.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Mayflies by Kevin O'Donnell tells the story of a generation ship, built as an escape from a dying Earth.	I'd add The Book of the Long Sun tetralogy by Gene Wolf.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I know they have to be careful with idiom at first in Stranger in a Strange Land.	It's a Philip K. Dick short story called The Eyes Have It.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		From my understanding a big part of how long the gate stays open is based on power consumption.	One theory is: Caesar was born with genetic variations with more human like genes resulting in more human-like vocal cords.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		This is a very often-debated subject‚Ä¶ You'll want to tailor the choice to that person's taste.	For a younger reader---especially but not exclusively a young lady---consider Wee Free Men, the first of the Tiffany Achings novels.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Star Wars has its own magnificent historical timeline in addition to being a masterfully executed space-based science fantasy.	The quality of the science is not really the question here.

STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		This type of warp drive is known as an Alcubierre drive, proposed by the Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre.	The matter-antimatter reaction is just the energy source for the work it has to do.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The WoT Wiki says that publication was pushed back from late 2011 to March 2012.	Brandon's latest post about this said it will not be out before Summer 2012, and should definitely be out by November.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Martinho lists everything I considered, but the one thing I think he missed was Ringworld Hindmost's engineering skill.	The Hindmosts, I recall, were Nike, then Baedeker, then Achilles (based on the XXX of Worlds series).
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The Doctor says in A Good Man Goes to War that it must've happened 'before America'.	It was before the season began because Amy saw the woman before the Silence took her.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Note: We had a very similar question on Writers.SE; I'm cross-posting my answer from there, adjusted to your specific question.	Fantasy stories need to go into details that real-world-based fiction doesn't: cultures, politics, religions, biology, magic, science, technology, you name it.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	2.20	Sign language maybe, since there is no tone to convey meaning, emotion or intent.	It is safe to say that body posture plays a big role in all languages.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	1.80	Remember, from the Fleet's point of view, the rest of the galaxy is what's moving and experiencing time dilation.	Well, it really depends on how long he was there, and the exact speed of the Fleet.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		I've always attributed this to the size of the debris that collided with the ship.	I think the shield technology is a little different than the later ellipsoid ones.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		It was learned with 2001: A Space Odyssey, released in 1968, that 100% pure space realism doesn't make for good sound design.	I was under the impression that, on some scenes, it was done properly.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		Yes, here is a quote from Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace script.	The novel I, Jedi touches on lightsabers, their construction, and their power.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		There is one difference between this question and the invisible man question.	If you look closely either with eyes or sensors you can observe a disruption where the ship is.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		The alien was, iirc, huddled on its side in a small alcove.	I guess you are talking about the first movie, Alien.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums		In addition to the already given reasons, there are some additional very good reason for this.	I can think of one notable reboot in print fiction.
STS2015GOLD	answers-forums	0.20	This idea has been around since the beginning of myth and storytelling.	The science behind superheroes might shed some light on this topic.

STS2015GOLD	belief		if that is what he did, he totally ignored the severity of the accusation, if not legally, but absolutely in terms of the impact it could have on his football program.	those idiots can only think of one answer to the question because anything else would spoinl their attempt to make this a race issue.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the forfeiture program is just a way for federal employees to enrich themselves at the expense of victims of crimes.	overt propaganda utilised as a means of empowering the state at the expense of the common man in the street!
STS2015GOLD	belief		perhaps they are starting to realize that the president isn't a cure-all for a damaged economy.	still trying to believe that the world is a zero sum game?

STS2015GOLD	belief		one other thing, the reason why most like me think private enterprise is the only way to go now is because our govt.	most of those truthers are likely to just move on after the election and look for other things to be pissed off about.
STS2015GOLD	belief		hear a different perspective each time.	but when i went the first time.

STS2015GOLD	belief		well our money hungry goverment has found another pretext to sieze money from well meaning capitalists.	fdny is city government and they were on site since the planes hit.
STS2015GOLD	belief		armed soldiers still patrol the capital, but discretely.	another uncle works at the janesville plant currently.
STS2015GOLD	belief		in that speech he claimed the murder rate in flint michigan had more than doubled already.	the jihadists have little hope of being able to hijack any more planes so easily.
STS2015GOLD	belief		for instance if we made cars without robots it would take 10x the manpower to produce what we now produce.	the reality is that they do exist and civil marriage brings with it large impacts on the transfer of property between spouses.

STS2015GOLD	belief	0.60	if people need help, just assume charity and local gov'ts aren't enough and just tax everyone else to pay for it, what's the difference?	if millions have a disastrous medical issue, like cancer, or hundreds or thousands have a natural disaster issue, what's the difference?

STS2015GOLD	belief		in that sense this is just the latest in a very long string of poor public relation and customer service incidents but this one is one of the stupider ones i've seen.	that's why the us has the largest prison population in the world, in both numbers, and as a percentage of the population.

STS2015GOLD	belief		what if they do try very hard at their homework and blow it at the test.	the whole world was astonished and followed the beast.
STS2015GOLD	belief		they are not made up of the usual zombietime bums, college students or acorn bussed in hacks and seiu union thugs or commie funded answer geeks.	they would retain all of their chinese, korean and other possessions and we would return their home island captures.
STS2015GOLD	belief		is there really monies in this ue ext.	and the race card is coming up next.

STS2015GOLD	belief		there is no possible way the cbo's or any of the various blogs cited numbers here can work.	here is a good point by point q&a analysis of these unrests in thailand.
STS2015GOLD	belief		sue your high school english teacher.	you help your dog chase its tail.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i am not sure if what i have written is what the coroner actually wants or what he can use.	i often wonder if he might have lived longer had he stayed with a more physically demanding job.

STS2015GOLD	belief		al sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion.	are you prepared to admit therefore that islam is a murderous religion?
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.60	think it's going to stay that way with less police?	is there any way that can be avoided?
STS2015GOLD	belief		ah, but then bush is bush!	so that is bull shit!
STS2015GOLD	belief		it has gone something like this: first, there was an effort to say that no warming existed at all.	it's one thing if you are just lazy and forget, but its another thing to lie about diaper changes all together.
STS2015GOLD	belief		honestly when you think about it it really does look just..	but only the shoreline around the terrace itself was really my idea of skate-friendly.

STS2015GOLD	belief	0.60	the government didn't have any thing to do with it.	either government has to honor religioius doctrine or it doesn't - pick one.
STS2015GOLD	belief		he's a very smart man.	haven't heard about that.

STS2015GOLD	belief		silly me i didnt total how much but it was about 4 debts in total and i am sure it must have been about 5k in total.	my purpose here is not to rabble rouse, but to have a meeting with like or similar minds to discuss what has been and is going on.
STS2015GOLD	belief		some just want america to fail.	he just doesnt get it.
STS2015GOLD	belief		determining the law and instructing the jury in that law is what the judge is for.	however, the way i see it is that by blaming the pundits i.e.

STS2015GOLD	belief		the school know he has this obviously and told the cdc he 'was fine' at school so the doc was really rude and said that i needed to do what the school was doing.	and the crowd would not be knowing that she would be adding more at the end, was sure applauding her story of what she did...
STS2015GOLD	belief		it could be worth a cheap ish course in assertivness (or a book).	it's another world out here - when we bought our house in '98, it was assessed at $67k.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i wouldn't be asking for anything in return but the chance to improve life for others.	why don't you start dealing with the facts before you try lecturing others.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the problem with these 'resolutions' targeting iran is that everyone can see the hypocrisy, its a case of our allies can have nukes but others can't.	the problem is, that i don't really have a life plan but i am the sort of person who likes to have things fairly planned out.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i fully and totally agree.	i'm really not sure why.
STS2015GOLD	belief	1.60	it's whether or not political rhetoric can cause people to do violence.	the effect people are talking about isn't simple political rhetoric designed to sway votes.

STS2015GOLD	belief		the next problem is that this world police has issued arms ownership licenses so liberally that the world police does not control the world territory.	the problem is, that i don't really have a life plan but i am the sort of person who likes to have things fairly planned out.
STS2015GOLD	belief		they live in england and should speek english!	what does keeping england english even mean?
STS2015GOLD	belief		they screwed the pooch on this story.	so that is the end of that.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it was bloody hard work and working for free to gain experience is a good thing.	i'm not very dogmatic about too many things, but i firmly believe young teens having sex is not a good thing.
STS2015GOLD	belief		and of all that only the maintenance and perhaps the engineering is generally us provided.	i just wanted to say that in my experience the fear of the unknown is the worst thing.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.20	lots of luck, she will get through this phase!	also, assuming the whole thing is a sham..
STS2015GOLD	belief		didn't figure in the interest that'll be due on it, did you?	i don't know of anywhere in the us where there's actual abject poverty.
STS2015GOLD	belief	2.00	i'd love to tear apart his lies, but i don't know how good i'd be on a radio show.	thanks for thinking of me, but i don't have the desire to appear on his show.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the crate i keep my puppy in is tiny...about	they didn't even have a train station...
STS2015GOLD	belief		but it said it was still investigating the cause and conducting a recovery operation at the site.	what i said was that he was working for someone else when his father died.
STS2015GOLD	belief		*drool* she may be a socialist, but at least she's a hot one!	edgar, you may be right - at least in part.
STS2015GOLD	belief		all those things you mention are the twisted twine ball of the government.	i most certainly did not treat the disaster as if it doesn't exist.
STS2015GOLD	belief		you speed walk in your sleep.	depending on you sex.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it's a tough call even for states, because of what i said in the first paragraph.	it's a tough call, but today's minimum is too low.

STS2015GOLD	belief		wtf is that all about?	how old is that program?
STS2015GOLD	belief		by the way, the truth of the super committee negotiations is that the democrats didn't off one single plan.	i'd say the precedent was set when the democrats gave clinton a pass for lying under oath.
STS2015GOLD	belief		england remains a world power, the rest degenerating under the yoke of socialism.	and i would appreciate armed strangers not trying to manage my own personal safety.
STS2015GOLD	belief		if your problem is with the banks,then sue the banks and try to get some money out of them.	your claim that he has killed 3 times as many al qeada is completely false.
STS2015GOLD	belief		my sister is getting ready to go to uni and i really am starting to resent him for how my life is now.	my sister is two years younger than i am, and i remember the day she came home from the hospital.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i have no problem with that.	we are at war with al-qaida.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.00	reality, of course, disagrees.	totally free of course.
STS2015GOLD	belief		in short, she doesn't have a clue what she's talking about.	once the disaster finally ends he may speak out.
STS2015GOLD	belief		plus, i'm kind of scared of him.	i did not feel ready to be home.
STS2015GOLD	belief		continue living off the backs of those who pay for their benefits without any obligation to offer anything in return?!	the site this was posted on had other problems with an account being frozen.
STS2015GOLD	belief		contrary to the persistent vomiting of 24hr news networks, the news doesn't really change as often as their advertisers would have you believe.	quote: the existence of 2 (presumably) youngish children would suggest that the marriage is not the cold and unrewarding one the husband would have you believe.
STS2015GOLD	belief		you cannot continue to 'be her friend' out of pity, and tbh you are not being true to yourself if you feel like this and then invite her places.	if it continues to be a problem i'd start showing your daily sheet to the director before you leave - let her see that mrs. i hasn't changed a diaper in 3 hours.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the fact that nixon and carter were uxorious did not make them good presidents.	that this message is deserved is not the point.
STS2015GOLD	belief		even in light of this recent information, repubs still say it was a waste.	sometimes i like to think that if the current generation had fought in that war, we would have lost.
STS2015GOLD	belief		spent many hours with her talking and listening, trying to make sense of her troubles and provide a shoulder to cry on.	put him in a room with any halfway intelligent free market economist and he turns into a blubbering moron.
STS2015GOLD	belief	3.20	to suggest that blacks are not poor due to external factors leaves black disproportionate poverty to be the result of internal factors, which could only mean that blacks are inferior.	to suggest that social and economic gaps are internal to blacks is to suggest that there is a genetic propensity that makes blacks inferior.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i would certainly label him a narcissist or a psychopath.	this would be an interesting story to keep up with.
STS2015GOLD	belief		for the most part, i think the market should be allowed to set it's own price, but would agree that there does have to be a minimum wage of some kind.	he's an adult. he should be courteous to your home and keep it clean, but outside of that he should be able to come and go as he pleases.
STS2015GOLD	belief		at least he didn't choose to carry a great big gun that killed his target, who was not committing any capital crime.	more often than not ows protestors are targeting their peers on the street rather than anyone who has committed any actual wrong doing.
STS2015GOLD	belief		he still has a job becuase the city was unaffected...but he lost his home.	this thing has gone just exactly as the democrats hoped.
STS2015GOLD	belief		this person is only going to get worse - not better.	there was nobody waiting for me to come home.
STS2015GOLD	belief		wow that vor person is a idiot!	would that be legal in this country?
STS2015GOLD	belief		oh spare us all this nonsense you keep pulling out of your ass.	just say you would like help in working out access for your son.
STS2015GOLD	belief		there are times, especially when we are pregnant, that we have to prioritize.	i believe the pals and israelis are fast getting to that point.
STS2015GOLD	belief		and tell them if they cannot wait how to protect themselves.	sue them and try to get some money out of them.
STS2015GOLD	belief		they are merely retaliating to whatever our politicians throw at them!	they are sitting on over a trillion dollars in cash.
STS2015GOLD	belief		is no consideration to be given to the crim?	why is no one sanctioning the us??
STS2015GOLD	belief		but they have new truck every year, a huge custom and all their kids dive nice cars and go to state collages.	but whatever happens, we need some national truth-telling, and we need to stop calling them the problem.
STS2015GOLD	belief		or maybe just a commutation of sentence like for scooter libby.	it may be a question of magnitude once again.
STS2015GOLD	belief		wanted to know if a bracelet i had listed at $14.50 was sterling silver.	and now it appears that there was a second one, that is now being uncovered.
STS2015GOLD	belief		police are convinced that there are people who know something, but no one has come forward with any information.	and if we continue to be a nation that allows sex with anyone, any time with anyone.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i'm sure that idea will win great support amongst the populous.	but i'm sorry to say i don't really take the ndp seriously.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it was my stepdad that had said so and so died of a broken heart and i would laugh.	hi, since bout a year after i started secondary school i've been getting this shoulder pain.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i clicked on everything and couldn't find a link.	timing is everything and this is not a good thing in the long run omho.
STS2015GOLD	belief		my bother, aunt, uncle and mysteriously this old women that was also involved in my court case.	not a single word said about the idiocy of someone that poor thinking about mating.
STS2015GOLD	belief		new zealand beer is also acceptable, as new zealand is pound for pound the greatest sporting nation on earth and it can only be due to the beer.	we know the date this happened, because we know when mom and sister came home from the hospital, so i was two years and two months old at the time.
STS2015GOLD	belief		some refused to go because they didn't want to be killed.	the rioters are pretty focused on the police and the president.
STS2015GOLD	belief	1.80	i agree with you about 'shouting about being different', what do you count as proclaiming difference?	i agree with you, quantum windbag, and so do most legal commentators i have read.
STS2015GOLD	belief	2.60	the international development secretary, hilary benn, the former health secretary alan milburn, and the leader of the commons, jack straw, are all at 25/1.	the foreign secretary, margaret beckett, is at 40/1, while the defence secretary, des browne, and the welsh and northern ireland secretary, peter hain are 50/1.
STS2015GOLD	belief		* stop giving money belonging to we the people, away to the corrupt politicians of foreign governments.	it sounds horrible but feeding these people is the worst thing you can do in the long run.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the way the system is designed, not much more than this is practically possible.	the father is not a public figure and is a private citizen.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i don't know what to make of the whole thing to be honest..	i can't see his death reducing the scale of the 'war on terror'..
STS2015GOLD	belief		but when it came to what i questioned?	to want to know he is safe ?
STS2015GOLD	belief		so i have been looking around for somewhere else.	(i have been in full time employment for 25 years).
STS2015GOLD	belief	3.00	don't you follow, and want our laws to follow all of leviticus?	she's on line here but hasn't answered as to whether or not she follows all of leviticus, and whether or not she want's our nation's laws to follow all of leviticus.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.70	in fact, watching fox will tell you the exact opposite of what you are claiming.	try dealing with the facts instead of your wishful thinking.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it is looking bad for ray right now.	meets dr. king; asks him for a job.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i never had any luck with the temp agencies, one time i got a voice mail from one of them saying they had a job for me.	if they have made peace with their pay, then there is no reason you should not be at peace with their pay as well.
STS2015GOLD	belief		always easy to blame others for your ineptitude.	they are with us for our lifetimes and beyond.
STS2015GOLD	belief	1.20	thus the need for health care insurance reform...the	is your health care rationed?
STS2015GOLD	belief		does this sound fair?would the kids be happier with two fathers who love them than a man and woman where only one parent really loves them?	i think it would have helped me draw a line between the traumatic events of her death and funeral and marked the start of my learning to deal with life without mum.
STS2015GOLD	belief		into actually rebuilding the country.	i dont have any dog in the fight.
STS2015GOLD	belief		crony capitalism has been on the fore front of political debate for at least a few years now.	it's whether or not political rhetoric can cause people to do violence.
STS2015GOLD	belief	3.40	and of course it not ever their fault, as it's now fox news, the righties, blaa blaa blaa.	now of course its everyones fault but their own.
STS2015GOLD	belief		now the space-shuttle program is going tits up thanks to him so we're pretty much out of the space business.	hope your little one is coping ok with the stress (although in this situation i bet the kids are much better than the parents).
STS2015GOLD	belief		false it is down 11%.	i would also not back down.
STS2015GOLD	belief		she is so sensitive that even if i don;t eat dinner she gets in a mood and takes it personally!	there's two entities that have zero interest in keeping obama in the white house.
STS2015GOLD	belief		we didn't really get anywhere so he dropped me home and told me to go and that it would be a 50 50 decision to split.	now - they are dangerous - cos they would move to another bottle, and it would all begin again.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i was in and out of the wards, civilian and va 2 or 3 times a year from 96 to 2000.	william hill have cut the odds on the prime minister leaving this year from 5/1 to 9/4.
STS2015GOLD	belief		after college i, like many others at the time, felt a compulsion to change what we saw as inequalities in the world and became a social worker.	i saw her all the time and we spoke about 6 times a day on the phone up until she was very ill in her last weeks and sleepy with morphine.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i asked if they had showed him the time as he needs visual prompts and she said 'i told him he had 10 minutes' i asked if she showed him 10 minutes and she said no.	he invited me in the past (while simultaneously saying i should be tried and executed), and i told him that i believe he is mentally ill and needs help, not attention.
STS2015GOLD	belief		usually, there is only 1 us at 20 weeks with my midwife unless there are other circumstances.	unfortunately they're going to end up at the same address six feet under - they be pals or israelis.

STS2015GOLD	belief		you think this whole thread is conspiracy theory bs?	why do you think that commandment is there?
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.80	or like oil companies, who have a cartel.	true oil only comes from quart sized cans.
STS2015GOLD	belief		that is exactly what happened: no, it isn't, unless you believe that the instant vaporization of hundreds of thousands of people can be written off because of their nationality.	they report that there are no planes coming in or out, and that there are tens of thousands of people at the airport.
STS2015GOLD	belief		again, you daft cunt, i'm not rich and i get great health coverage.	i wouldn¬ít be able to change to a buy to let mortgage.

STS2015GOLD	belief		common sense tells us that bankers that have to sell their third vacation home are the one's with entitlement issues.	however my cash flow is better with them then without since the rental income more than covers the mortgages on them plus...
STS2015GOLD	belief	2.00	i don't actually give two figs what minimum wage does for or against the economy.	the idea of regular increments to minimum wage is a good one - for businesses to cope with them.
STS2015GOLD	belief		thank god for the 99%ers' they seem to understand the system is rigged.	then i found others that countered what she said.
STS2015GOLD	belief		so it is a big deal that they are coming.	so now it is a fight for freedom of choice.
STS2015GOLD	belief	1.60	the tea party didn't promote ending the intereference of religion in politics.	in this case it is the freedom of choice vs. the freedom of religion.

STS2015GOLD	belief		i curse worse than a sailor so i felt it was best to think about those choice words for her.	oil is washing up north of miamui beach on the east side of florida.

STS2015GOLD	belief		i agreed to marry him.	you will learn to make real chips.

STS2015GOLD	belief		it seems like every time something goes on between my husband and i that his friends have to get involved or make rude comments.	it seems like the best option would have been something like hey, i think this violin is fake and paypal is saying i have to destroy it to get my money back.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it may destabilize the gulf for a while, but in the long run it will prove to be fruitful.	if the government provides health care, whether spelled out in this bill or not, it will ration the care.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.00	our justice system is rotten to the core, so what are we going to do about it?	do you think she just told you not to bother because you just had a baby not to long ago?
STS2015GOLD	belief		if you want to learn absolutely nothing, whilst watching the poor old teacher trying to play a role that largely consists of being a jail warden, then go to a comprehensive.	if you want to change society's morals you appeal to the hearts and minds of the people that are willing to listen and if they embrace it what you find to be immoral will eventually die out on it's own.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i don't need you to state whether you've excused it or not, by your actions its clear that you have.	i don't mean to be dense, but why do you have to find out what his long term intentions are?
STS2015GOLD	belief		they are the voice and interpreters of this tort and did their duty.	there are a few other early memories, but i can't date them.

STS2015GOLD	belief	3.00	this has been so usual for us that i can bring her home and not change her again til 6:30 or 7 and her diaper is still peed in but not full at all.	whenever we pick her up from all but one of the teachers, her sheet says she was changed at 4:30ish and when i change her again at 6:30 or 7 her diaper is fine.
STS2015GOLD	belief		(this is in primary by the way).	i didn¬ít do as well at stanford, by the way.
STS2015GOLD	belief		in your own mind, maybe, outside of it, the word may take on a different meaning.	my brother is an alcoholic, with 2 daughters from 2 different marriages.
STS2015GOLD	belief	1.60	in actual practise, the clinics tend to keep the embryos on ice because they fear law suits.	in their view, there is a difference between an embryo and a brain dead person.

STS2015GOLD	belief	0.20	conventional weapons may not even be able to hit some of the fortified facilities either.	obviously you're totally ignorant as to the make up of the people participating in the protests.

STS2015GOLD	belief		it does exist, and it's a fucking crime.	i cant stand to smell of cooking food.
STS2015GOLD	belief		newt's relations with women are at best reprehensible.	it's just who we are as a society.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it simply covers the things we have been talking about.	quite simply because they're pissing on the graves of those who died.
STS2015GOLD	belief		this is england, we are a 3rd world dumping ground for some reason..	so i have been looking around for somewhere else.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i know when the only solution is to spend trillions for minimal, unproven benefit, i know the liar is a leftist.	however, i might try to find someone with the means and skills to investigate the position because i do think it has merit.
STS2015GOLD	belief	3.40	so if the jury was in fact instructed incorrectly, chances are they will not come to the correct conclusion.	the jury is to be instructed as to the law to be applied to the facts they determine, not the other way around.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the problem i have here is that the wbc's site isn't a memorial site for matthew snyder, it is their own property to disseminate their point of view.	however, there is no drama that he was involved with anna chapman or any other honey pot involved with russian or us mafias.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the former home secretary charles clarke is the outsider at 66/1.	the nurse needs a scientific calculator to take your pulse.

STS2015GOLD	belief		there are no groups of right wingers dancing in the streets waving signs that say death to liberals!	they said there was fighting amongst kids in the street and this seemed to be normal and tolerated.
STS2015GOLD	belief		¬ïpresident bush presided over a $2.5 trillion increase in the public debt through 2008.	president obama has proposed a $634 billion down payment on a new govern*ment health care fund.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i along with other christians will bow to allah (who is the same god i worship anyway) and watch the fireworks.	it's their choice as to what services they will provide and what they won't.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the constant stream of pinocchios he has gotten from the washington post, on easily checked facts, demonstrates this.	the first baptist church in his hometown had to take up a collection to support the family gingrich had deserted.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i want to thank all of you who participated and also craven for giving us the opportunity.	i don't actually give two figs what minimum wage does for or against the economy.

STS2015GOLD	belief		ann coulter didn't laugh.	and it didnt bother me.
STS2015GOLD	belief		in their view, there is a difference between an embryo and a brain dead person.	i don't believe most progressives even understand the difference between the state and federal government.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.20	yes, there are many variables that affect prices, and trying to explain it through one company is not realistic.	also, there are hints that these concerns are from scientists who only want to fund their own pet projects.
STS2015GOLD	belief		do not pay attention to the evidence!	so you may want to consider my advice.
STS2015GOLD	belief		that was also about a blow job, of course.	he was caught lying to congress.

STS2015GOLD	belief	0.00	and besides they do update their platform.	i will do so with my daughter this year...
STS2015GOLD	belief		so nursing care isn't wonderful.	it was our day, how we wanted and it was wonderful.
STS2015GOLD	belief		hardly fills me with confidence that they should be allowed to have nuclear weapons.	he also advised that as there had been evidence they should have logged it as a crime.
STS2015GOLD	belief		perhaps its time for budget and personel cuts in the justice dept if all you have to do is bust for weed.	it wasn't fun really, but if you need to be induced then you have to do what you need to do.
STS2015GOLD	belief		we called the campgrounds and the owners said they had cleaned our campsite and did not find anything.	he and the democrats got damn near everything they wanted and they still reneged on it before the ink was dry.

STS2015GOLD	belief		laws should be for everyone.	we could go tit for tat over and over.
STS2015GOLD	belief		since being made redundant i have worked really hard at both getting the house together and finding another job.	one thing they found particularly hard to deal with was other young men attaching themselves to their group and being undislodgeable (a nwe word and it's only 9 am!).

STS2015GOLD	belief		the left is fighting for freedom of choice.	there is strong demand for us education.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.00	the president's biological father was kenyan, and obama barely knew him.	the justice system is a farce and we all know it.

STS2015GOLD	belief		anyone that has a nickel in their pocket has a part in controlling commerce.	ows has already launched the class war into the consciousness of millions of americans.
STS2015GOLD	belief		practically, nobody cared.	i fully and totally agree.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it appears that, though you claim to value education - we must have very different understandings of what the word 'education' means also.	the arab league did not understand that a no fly zone can have different meanings if worded appropriately.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i just wondered if anyone else had been in the same situation and could offer me some advice so i can move forward from this.	i have suffered from anxiety and depression in the past and she was the one person who could calm me down and make everything alright.
STS2015GOLD	belief		in america we have a thing called due process.	do you know the great thing about numbers.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i already showed you that there has been no decrease in outgoing lw radiation since 1970 according to the satellite record in spite of a marked increase in atmospheric co2.	i agree that there has to be a reasonable amount of secrecy in a case like this.
STS2015GOLD	belief		they are a pissed off and unaffiliated new breed of political monster that no one knows what to make of yet.	as to the rest of that lunatic ranting and political positioning on whitehouse.gov,
STS2015GOLD	belief		got in and out with relative ease the last time i went.	he got bin laden from a place that bush didn't dare to go into.
STS2015GOLD	belief		this won't be the last rise in tuition fees.	that was the ultimate insult to him.
STS2015GOLD	belief		what are scientists who are educated in how to treat and prevent the problem going to do?	but there is nothing that you are willing to do that will rectify the problem.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i think there is a broader view of holding people accountable that your conveniently ignore with your argument.	i think there are a number of high-profile crimes where criminals are held long long after the point where they are a danger to anyone.
STS2015GOLD	belief		three of the seals being rescued were also killed and the fourth wounded.	even our r&d is being jobbed-out to faraway india and other parts of the world.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.00	it gives me just as good a reason never to use ebay.	just how good a basis is revenge for sentencing?
STS2015GOLD	belief		as unions usually do, they chose keeping their benefits at the level they are, over keeping cops on the job, and the lay offs happened.	unions are for those that have no other skill other than a 5th grade educated worker has with a hammer in their hand.
STS2015GOLD	belief	2.20	i really dont know what to do...	i don't really know what is up but i'm super mad about it.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it's kind of scary but the thing is he wants to be caught, he's just making people work to catch him.	it is a national campaign that wants people to stop snitchin' on people who commit crimes.
STS2015GOLD	belief		are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news?	actually, the whole contraception drum is being pounded by the liberals in an attempt at gotcha politics.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.00	the bush administration put them back in.	they didn't get it, but they asked for it.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i chose to allow him to do so.	i heard about this two weeks ago.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i wonder whether khadaffi's move heralds a new direction in the realtionship between the west and the formerly anti-us arab nations.	he does have lots of really interesting ideas about the economy and the us's relations with the rest of the world that are worth listening to.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the conversation turned to politics, which led eventually to a rather silly looking woman (rslw) saying that she hated the bnp.	the verses above from leviticus are in a section of the bible that lists immoral acts and the penalties for them.
STS2015GOLD	belief		wher the women even those pregnant were not allowed any breaks except a 30 minute lunch perid.	we then gave our insurance company the crime ref number and the receipts of the items stolen.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it was so secret that james bamford was able to write a book about in 1982, the puzzle palace.	it was my stepdad that had said so and so died of a broken heart and i would laugh.

STS2015GOLD	belief	0.00	until two days ago, i didn't know they actually made guns for kids (and i'm not talking about toy guns).	source thomas do you have data on how the insurance industry is preparing for or speaking about gw?
STS2015GOLD	belief		i do appreciate the fact this shooter was not charged or detained, since he was acting within his understanding of the laws we have now.	i lost my mum and i felt the same way, for quite a long time, so i think i understand how it is for you.
STS2015GOLD	belief		even though i do work, but he is the one that pays the majority of our bills.	i think they could at least specify the varity of apple used.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i will say that i have never found an article on the milwaukee voucher program that proves it's working.	they are literally saying that going above one's superiors is worse than going to the police once one's superiors take action.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the high court declared the case against the machines moot since the justice department has now cleared the machines, and ordered another part back to court to decide a fight over attorney fees.	both sides could have used better attorneys on this, the arguments dance around the real issues and ignore the facts - on both sides.
STS2015GOLD	belief		problem i see is not the color of people that live in here and not from where they come.	problem is clinton did something no other president did, he violated the oval office by having sex thaere and then lying about it.
STS2015GOLD	belief		that's why i no longer laugh at them.	it's not like he needs the money.
STS2015GOLD	belief		we created 11 million jobs.¬î	they saved millions of lives.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i still like you, but i am beginning to wonder why.	we still have not got a decision from them.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the vote for gay marriage is about to happen in maine.	people still care about what happened, i do.
STS2015GOLD	belief		sorry to rant about gypsies so much, but there is so few that listen, i take my chances whenever i can.	i am sorry for this news to you but this has been the case since...well,
STS2015GOLD	belief		this september i left home, and started at university.	they had to be air lifted in somewhere around the first of june.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i am also reading about that recently (e.g.	if not, stop talking about due process.
STS2015GOLD	belief		they never get presidential attendence do they?	but the police have to do something, don't they?
STS2015GOLD	belief		this contraception thing is nothing but a new shiny object to distract the easily distracted and unfocused republicans.	the first baptist church in his hometown had to take up a collection to support the family gingrich had deserted.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.00	actually, it's people who build the robots since not enough are being made to create an assembly line.	of course, people who work with sick animals know that when the mean ones stop being mean, death is peeking around the corner.
STS2015GOLD	belief		police say that's a standard practice whenever a taser is used.	sounds like we are falling foul of the eu standard practice in the way we treat our nationals.
STS2015GOLD	belief		totally free of course.	obama agreed and compromised.
STS2015GOLD	belief		but at least i'll have peace of mind that he's ok.	thanks i think it can be very easy to focus on what he doesn't do.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.00	i know they are not saving and i just cant understand!	things are so big and strange.
STS2015GOLD	belief		lefties are either constantly outraged or the poor victum.	chances are it will move more to the middle over time.
STS2015GOLD	belief		seems there isn't a whole lot of disagreement with this decision after all.	i am told that when lenders agree to this, it¬ís on a short term basis.
STS2015GOLD	belief		something needs to change before we aren't a so called democracy anymore.	nope, as i have said before we haven't been up to much of that.
STS2015GOLD	belief		sorry to moan but i really feel down now and dont know what to do or say.	you just completed another sweater and you don't know how to knit.
STS2015GOLD	belief		and since they are not taxing my parents, and this is new money to me, then it has the right to be taxed.	and he got a whole lot of millage out of sexual harrassment bs at the time of the thomas hearings.
STS2015GOLD	belief	0.40	we should start a sequence of these threads ;-).	we should have monuments for him.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it exists on the other end of the spectrum.	what is even more bothersome to me personally...
STS2015GOLD	belief		if she cant communicate then her familywould be free to do what they wanted with her without getting found out.	he told the the administration what they wanted to hear.
STS2015GOLD	belief		you can take a picture of yourself from ten feet away without using the timer.	but the fact is, you idiots fired her before anyone knew about the story.
STS2015GOLD	belief		but man are a lot of middle class and even poor americans brainwashed.	there's also a side issue of amicus waivers.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i don't spend my days surfing for news bytes to find something to bitch about.	i don't mean for president; i mean out of the country.
STS2015GOLD	belief		care i think sinatra unsubscribed from his own thread.	i have seen the streams run as black slurries from strip mining.
STS2015GOLD	belief		for example, it's okay for you to impose your value, because you are special?	you're better off without him in your life, and you'll have a life.
STS2015GOLD	belief		and when that happens, it hurts the feelings of our troops.	and what happened to that lie you were going to cite in cristol's book?
STS2015GOLD	belief		i lost my mum and i felt the same way, for quite a long time, so i think i understand how it is for you.	was worth just over ¬£10k at the time with only 7,000 miles on the clock i think and i got it for ¬£6,200.
STS2015GOLD	belief		mike mcqueary is an interesting case in that he was practically raised to be a part of the penn state family.	i mean not even everyone in hk is a british national - only a proportion of the population are.
STS2015GOLD	belief		tens of thousands of americans!	and this was of particular interest.
STS2015GOLD	belief		they offered up private solutions, good ones, ones that don't increase taxes on anyone.	neither government nor people should impose their values on anyone.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i think it's a real shame on the part of our government for treating them like this.	i think this is what the original starter of the thread (joshw) is driving at.
STS2015GOLD	belief		aig gets bailed out, then gives multi-million dollar bonuses in the very same year.	here is a partial list: - the stimulus has created millions of jobs in the private sector.
STS2015GOLD	belief		in russia, 56% positively evaluate the work of obama.	i am positively surprised about this choice.
STS2015GOLD	belief		this, had we be wiling to talk about it seriously at the time, would have been legitimate cause for concern.	had that been on the 5.30pm from victoria it would have been a goner.
STS2015GOLD	belief		they might be hiding him or something, in which case what is the problem?	i said i complain the 3 or so times a month i ring with the same problem.
STS2015GOLD	belief		at least that is my hope.	@edgarblythe, that is very sad.
STS2015GOLD	belief	4.60	why didn't we ever hear about it during the bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled?	but they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the bush admin.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it's one thing if you are just lazy and forget, but its another thing to lie about diaper changes all together.	i am wrong about the unemployment rate, but every other point i made about obama is true.
STS2015GOLD	belief		none of them conformed to the conditions set out and agreed to by the allies.	so we now heve to wait for a decision to be handed down from the mountaintop.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i try not to assume i fully understand those i encounter, but i do react to things i see and i do have opinions.	i assume that if pronation is normal the shoes may be just fine; if not, yes, i might see an orthopedist for an opinion.
STS2015GOLD	belief		nothing i could do will change the face of the past.	you could kill an entire police force.
STS2015GOLD	belief		come out of your plane and hump in my boots!	you lie through your teeth and still get votes.
STS2015GOLD	belief		childhood, as just an aspect of being human, is a rather recent concept.	this isn't just an american problem, this is the worlds problem.
STS2015GOLD	belief		a veritable achievement indeed.	charge him board and let him be independant.
STS2015GOLD	belief		folks will be lined up outside the polling places, just waiting to color in the dot next to any democrat that goes up against these baboons!	walking the gauntlet up the steps of the police station in cambridge was a piece of cake compared to the beating we took in the back room.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i know i'm just a mere human, i have no right to question a corporation.	what many fail to realize is that exiling arafat might not be an option.
STS2015GOLD	belief		some of the autobiographies are good though, i've got major's, thatchers, hestletine's, lawson's and howe's.	show me where the health insurance companies are coming together to protest the contraception mandate.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i know i'm just a mere human, i have no right to question a corporation.	what many fail to realize is that exiling arafat might not be an option.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the fact that you indicated they are not open monday tells me this is a ground/home delivery shipment - express delivers seven days a week, altho there are surcharges for weekend deliveries.	they cheat in elections, they lie about nearly everything and hate everyone who varies even a little bit from what they already have cemented in their brain cases.
STS2015GOLD	belief		so, i answered her question patiently and honestly.	in no way was he better on the question of the war than johnson.
STS2015GOLD	belief		something d-man doesn't want to touch on.	someone needs to go to jail for that one.
STS2015GOLD	belief		however, they did strive to make everyone equal under the law.	however, they were held accountable for it all the same.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the millionaires got one.	to them it was good enough.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the solution will not or should not be requesting a schedule change for ms.i.	the net result would be devastating to the poorest of the poor.
STS2015GOLD	belief		the majority of this nation believes in god and believes that he will turn on us.	as to the rest of that lunatic ranting and political positioning on whitehouse.gov,
STS2015GOLD	belief		hopefully you have been declaring this income to the taxman?	why do you hate people that work in their own home?
STS2015GOLD	belief		what kind of history do the us have then?	what did you edit out?
STS2015GOLD	belief		in fact, watching fox will tell you the exact opposite of what you are claiming.	try dealing with the facts instead of your wishful thinking.
STS2015GOLD	belief		girls who play bisexual for male attention are just infuriating though, and absolutely demean the efforts and image of lgbt people.	such people aren't capable of rational thought and only understand violence.
STS2015GOLD	belief		this has been talked about for some time though.	the cat has your collective tongues.
STS2015GOLD	belief		it's the biggest, hottest news story in media.	this is why the right is destined to lose its ass.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i never got a birthday or xmas card, let alone anything else.	you know what teenagers are like, they pick up on anything.
STS2015GOLD	belief		removing the staples was horrible and weird.	reality is, i was there before and returned again.
STS2015GOLD	belief		she has said that the club has helped her with the grieving as she has so many friends there.	it was the same offer we accepted after we targeted civilians with the a-bombs and dropped them.

STS2015GOLD	belief		how long ago was this?	so what do you think?

STS2015GOLD	belief		he does not have the balls to put his own numbers on the table, and suggest how they pay for it.	i had moved to new york to be close to the power center of the country for my anti war activity.
STS2015GOLD	belief		i would look up the yellow pages for advice places and give them a phone.	well them you, squire, have never heard of one.
STS2015GOLD	belief		hiya all -long posting alert!!!!	why all the lying about this on your part?
STS2015GOLD	belief		while i'm sure mr schlesinger enjoyed taking a swipe at the departed mr bush, he adds nothing to the debate.	the story that a soldier related to larry king about how he died is now known to be a false.
